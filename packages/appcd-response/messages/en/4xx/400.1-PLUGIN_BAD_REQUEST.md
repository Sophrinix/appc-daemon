# Bad Plugin Request

## Plugin directory does not exist

The specified directory either does not exist, is not accessible, or is not a directory.

## Plugin directory does not contain a `package.json`

Every plugin must have a `package.json` that contains a `name` property.

## Error reading plugin package.json file

The plugin's `package.json` is either malformed JSON or empty.

## Plugin package.json missing "name" property

The plugin's `package.json` must have a non-empty `name` property.

## Forbidden plugin name

The plugin name is not allowed. An example would be a plugin with the name `appcd` would not be
permitted because it will conflict with the internal `appcd` namespace.

## Cannot unload internal plugins

Internal plugins cannot be unloaded. Only external plugins can be unloaded. This is because internal
plugins are loaded into the same process as the main Appc Daemon and it is virtually impossible to
destroy any variables or functions a plugin may define internally including those defined by 3rd
party NPM dependencies.
